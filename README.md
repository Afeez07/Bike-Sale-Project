# Bike Buyer Analysis Project

## Description

This project analyzes a dataset of potential bike buyers to understand the demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing purchasing decisions. The goal is to identify key characteristics and patterns associated with customers who choose to buy a bike.

## Dataset

The analysis uses data derived from `bike_buyers.csv` (initial data) and `WORKSHEET.csv` (analysis worksheet). The dataset includes information on 1000 individuals, covering attributes such as:

* **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Marital Status, Region, Children
* **Socioeconomic:** Income, Education, Occupation, Home Ownership, Cars
* **Commute:** Commute Distance
* **Target Variable:** Purchased Bike (Yes/No)

An engineered feature, `Age Bracket`, was also included in the analysis worksheet.

## Analysis Performed

The project involved the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading & Inspection:** Loading the dataset(s).
2.  **Data Cleaning/Preparation:** (Assumed, based on the presence of `WORKSHEET.csv` and `Age Bracket`).
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examining distributions and relationships between variables.
4.  **Comparative Analysis:** Using descriptive statistics and pivot tables to compare characteristics of individuals who purchased bikes versus those who did not. Key comparisons included average income, age groups, occupation, and region. (Findings partially captured in `PIVOTTABLE.csv`).
5.  **Visualization:** Creating charts to illustrate key trends (e.g., income distribution for buyers vs. non-buyers).

## Key Findings

* Initial analysis suggests that individuals who purchased bikes tend to have a slightly higher average income compared to those who did not.

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel

## How to Use/Replicate

The raw data is available in `bike_buyers.csv`. The primary data used for analysis is in `WORKSHEET.csv`. The `PIVOTTABLE.csv` file contains exported summaries from pivot table analysis performed in Excel.
